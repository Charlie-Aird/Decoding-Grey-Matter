# Decoding-Grey-Matter

Decoding Grey Matter: large-scale analysis of brain cell morphometry to inform microstructural modeling of diffusion MR signals, is a work to extract morphological characteristics from neural reconstructions.

The frame work allows for the analysis of nueral cells, represented as connected graphs and saved as swc files, extracting structural, shape and topological characteristcs.

Structural cahracteristics pertain to fundemental features of the cells, such as soma radius, dendritic branch length, and dentrite tortuosity.

The codes present here can be ued to analyse any reconstruction provided they are in the form of an swc file.
